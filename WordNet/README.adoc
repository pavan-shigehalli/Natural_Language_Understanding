Each group of synsets is linked together
according to their semantic relations. WordNet can also be described as a thesaurus but
with more complex relations among the vocabulary. NLTK python package has inbuilt
WorNet modules. The scripts here measures the performance of WordNet with the triplet
data set.

set an upper limit on the CPU temperature, and the system memory usage,
then please run `validate_wordnet.sh`
