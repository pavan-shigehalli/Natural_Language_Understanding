== Natural Language Understanding in Argumentative Dialogue Systems

This repository contains the python scripts for various natural language
processing models which I worked on my master's thesis

Understanding in Argumentative Dialogue System]

=== Introduction
The following figure <<dialogue_system>> shows the general structure of a
dialogue system (DS).

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts the user speech
to the text. The text is then analyzed and understood in Natural Language
Understanding (NLU). Dialogue manager keeps track of the input and the corresponding
responses. Natural Language Generation (NLG) generates the appropriate responses,
which are converted to the speech by text to speech. The goal of the thesis is to
implement NLU for an argumentative DS. The following figure <<NLU_module>>
shows the NLU structure.

The NLU design is influenced by the way humans understand an utterance in a discussion.
In a discussion, we argue based on our knowledge base about the topic. Richer the
information we have, better is the quality of the argument. Moreover, the responses
also depend on the intention of the opponent. For example, we respond differently for
opponents trying to concede, argue, or retract.

The design consist of an utterance mapper, a database and an intent classifier.
The database contains arguments about a topic.
The utterance mapper finds the sentence closest to the user utterance in the Database.
Intent classifier detects the move played by the user in an argument game.
A user can have four types moves or the intents, argue, why(asking for more information
about the previous statement ), retract and concede.
Both these outputs are needed to synthesize the response.

The utterance mapper is implemented by various models like
the ones which exploit the linguistic properties of the English language such as,
WordNet, models which rely on the vector representation of words like GloVe, BERT.
The performance of these models are measured with different similarity measurement
techniques. The similarity measurement techniques include various distance
measurements and certain aspects of IBM project debater.

We use the sample Wikipedia dataset released by
link:http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml[IBM project debater]
to train GloVe. BERT trained model is downloaded from the
link:https://github.com/google-research/bert[Google release]. WordNet model is
downloaded from the NLTK package.

For the performance measurement of GloVe, BERT, WordNet and similarity
measurement techniques of IBM project debater, we convert this dataset into
a dataset of sentence triplets. A sentence triplet is a set of three sentences
where two sentences are semantically closer than the third. A successfully trained
model should identify the relation between the triplets.

Intent classification is implemented by the chat bot designs such as RASA.

The database is constructed according to <<rach>>. It contains a sample debate
from the database of link:https://idebate.org/debatabase[idebate.org].
Idebate.org is operated by the International Debate
Education Association (IDEA), a global Network of organisations who educate people
in debate.
